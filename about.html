            <p>I am Blend Melenica, a 19-year old from Vushtrri. My father Nexhmedin is from Vushtrri as well, while my mother Fatmire is from Vuthaj, Montenegro. I have two sisters
                , they are both older than me and both have finished medical school. I grew up in Vushtrri, only recently having come to Prishtina for studies alongside my siblings.
                I went to a public middle school and to Mehmet Akif College for High School. When the opportunity arose for me to enroll in RIT-K I just could not turn it down! 
            </p>
            <p>I am a man of many interests and hobbies, web development and programming being one of them. I have enrolled in many courses to further my knowledge on these topics and i 
                aspire to get a job this summer in the field I love!

                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <p>
                    Sports has always been a keen point of interest for me, especially basketball! When playing basketball, for a moment, all the worries and outside stimuli falls out of the window,
                    the only thing that currently matters is the game itself. It is a fun getaway activity to expend some energy in but also have fun! Not only that, but it is very healthy too,
                    strengthening your muscles and joints and aiding your health in a plethora of different ways!

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    I love music, listening to it or singing. Music, in many ways can make one feel things that cannot be described or felt through any other activity. It can be fun, interactive, realistic,
                    sad, preaching etc. I believe it is one of the most important ways of expressing one's soul. I personally listen to all genres the same, they all bring something different to the table.
                    If you feel like dancing, singing or sleeping, there is music out there for everything!

                <h2>Computers</h2>
                <p>
                    Computers were a thing of marvel for me in the past. I was and still am fascinated by the capabilities of such compact devices. From my younger years when I used to play games all day, to today
                    when I use them to build powerful programs and algorithms, computers are capable of everything! And I am not saying this just because it will get me a job :).
